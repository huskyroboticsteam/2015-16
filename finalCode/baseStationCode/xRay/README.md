This folder contains tools used to read sample data from an AmpTek X-Ray detector and identify elements contained within a sample.

## Required Software

In order to use the tools here, you must have the following already installed on your computer:

* (Anaconda)[https://www.continuum.io/downloads]
    * Anaconda is a Python programming environment that has tools for plotting and numerical analysis built-in. I
      *highly* recommend using this to install all the packages you will need to run this tool, but specifically,
      you need to have NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib. If there is any issue with installing Anaconda, contact me
      either by phone or email (listed above) and I will help you get the packages installed manually. **Note for
      installation: You should get two check boxes to select when installing: one about adding Python to the PATH,
      and another about making Python 3.5.1 the default interpreter. Make sure to select both check boxes.**
      
* (MinGW)[http://www.mingw.org/]
    * MinGW is a tool used to compile C++ programs on Windows. **Note for Brandon: This tool should already be installed on
      your computer, so you don't have to worry about installing and setting this up.**
